# Logistic-Regression
This project involves building and deploying a logistic regression model to predict a target variable.

The workflow includes:

1.Data Exploration (EDA): Load the dataset, examine feature types and summary statistics, and visualize distributions and relationships using histograms, box plots, and pair plots. Identify patterns or correlations in the data.

2.Data Preprocessing: Handle missing values through imputation and encode categorical variables for model compatibility.

3.Model Building: Train a logistic regression model using libraries like scikit-learn.

4.Model Evaluation: Evaluate model performance on test data using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and ROC-AUC score. Visualize the ROC curve.

5.Interpretation: Analyze the model coefficients to understand the significance of features in predicting the target variable.

6.Deployment with Streamlit: Create a Streamlit app to deploy the trained model. Users can input data to get predictions locally or online via Streamlit Community Cloud.
